## Summary

### AI errors, hallucinations and risks identified
| # | Issue | Type | How found | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Misread which document the team meant (Doc 3 instead of the SRS) | Misinterpretation | Review of the AI's reply | Team redirected the AI |
| E2 | Wrong priority counts in Appendix B | Arithmetic error | Counting script | Corrected |
| E3 | FR-34 / FR-39 gaps (modification holds; refund retry) | Specification gap | Writing use-case extensions | FRs amended |
| E4 | PlantUML name collision merged an actor into a package | Diagram defect | Rendering and inspection | Aliases renamed |
| E5 | Activity-diagram step in the wrong swimlane | Diagram defect | Rendering and inspection | Fixed |
| E6 | Generator bug deleted three terms from RTM §6.1 | Tooling defect | Reading the output back | Patched |
| E7 | Agent granted INSERT-only yet shown performing an UPDATE (SD-6) | **Design contradiction** | Self-review of the SADD | Supersession moved to a `caf_app` job |
| E8 | Deployment diagram implied the DB runs on EC2 | Misleading diagram | Rendering and inspection | Redrawn |
| E9 | Render check reported the wrong exit code | Verification flaw | Noticed during checking | Strict re-check run |
| E10 | Markdown preview needed an unconfigured PlantUML server | Tooling gap | Error message | Local server + VS Code task |
| E13 | Agent role granted UPDATE, contradicting NFR-25 | **Design contradiction** | Cross-verification | Bookkeeping moved to `caf_app` |
| E14 | Data model missing columns/tables the text relies on | Incomplete design | Cross-verification | ER diagram completed |
| E15 | In-memory rate limits would break under multiple workers | **Design gap** | Cross-verification | Shared `rate_limits` table |
| E16 | Payment-failure response codes defined only in the SADD | Cross-document inconsistency | Cross-verification | Added to SRS §4.0 |
| E17 | RE-03 issue count stated approximately ("about 85") | Imprecise record | Counting script | Corrected to 82 |
